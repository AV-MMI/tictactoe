Tic Tac Toe Project
 
In this project i put on practice what i've learned about the module pattern as a way to no pollute the global namespace, and the use of factory functions instead of. One of the things that caught my atention while i was doing this project is that what would be the difference between the creation of variables using `let`, and the encapsulation of them in a module pattern, the thing is, that the use of the module pattern corresponds to a time where we didn't have something like `let`. In those times we would use `var` to create variables, and while `let` and `const` are block-closure types, `var` is a global-closure type, making the use of the module pattern something necessarily in the case in which we may have multiple functions or variables with the same name, or just to avoid a collision in the global namespace.

In what respect to the use of factory functions and object constructor we must keep in mind what is the real utility of them: they allow us to return an object, to create automatically objects with determined properties and values. The difference between them is that an Object Constructor use `this` to declare the properties and values of the new object, the thing is that if we invoke and Object Constructor without using the `new` keyword it will produce a silent bug due to the fact that the Object Constructor won't return the desired object (in fact it will return 'undefined'). That's where the advantage of using a factory function is at, we don't need to use the `new` keyword everytime that we are creating/returning a new object, instead, we just create an object in our factory function, assign to it the correspondent values and then we return the desire object.

I think that the most tought challenge in this project was the implementation of the Minimax algorithm, but once I caught the fundamentals i was able to implement and modify it where it was needed.

Object Constructor Syntax:
```
function personConstructor(name, gender, age){
	this.name = name;
	this.gender = gender;
	this.age = age;
};

let janeDoe = new personConstructor('Jane', 'Female', 23); // good
let johnDoe = personConstructor('John', 'Male', 22); // bad
```

Factory Function Syntax:
```
function personFactory(name, gender, age){
	let newObj = {};
	
	newObj.name = name;
	newObj.gender = gender;
	newObj.age = age;

	return newObj;
}

let janeDoe = personFactory('Jane', 'Female', 22); // good

// or

function songFactory(title, gender, duration){
	return {
		name,
		gender,
		duration,
	}
};

let aiPreto = songFactory('Ai Preto', 'Funk', '2:08');
```
